# Self-Driving Car

## Overview
This project implements a simple self-driving car simulation using JavaScript and neural networks. The goal is to create an AI-powered car that can navigate a track while avoiding obstacles, simulating the principles of autonomous driving.

## Features
- ðŸš— **AI-Powered Car:** Uses a neural network to control the car's movement.
- ðŸ§  **Machine Learning:** Implements a simple neural network to learn from training data.
- ðŸŽ® **User Controls:** Allows manual control for testing purposes.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Visualization:** Real-time rendering of car movement and sensor data.
- ðŸ“‚ **Data Storage:** Saves trained models for future use.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript** â€“ Core programming language
- **HTML & CSS** â€“ UI and visualization
- **Brain.js** â€“ Neural network library
- **Canvas API** â€“ For rendering the track and car

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kristinashres55/self-driving-car.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd self-driving-car
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to run the simulation.

## Usage
- Use arrow keys to control the car manually.
- Train the AI by running multiple simulations.
- Observe the AI learning and improving over time.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a better neural network architecture.
- Add more complex tracks and obstacles.
- Enhance the UI for better visualization.
